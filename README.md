# swchs-2018SpringV2
Poker game for SWCHS Coding Club

This is some code that we are using in the SouthWest Christian High School Coding Club spring semester 2018 to learn about Web Development and the software development process.

The purpose of this class is to introduce HTML, CSS and JS to my students, as well as give them some basic development methods, OOP, logic structures, process flow and some "Best Practices" for software development. There was no attempt to teach Database, in-depth UX/UI, API's, Web Services or even server-side programming.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT COMPLETE
